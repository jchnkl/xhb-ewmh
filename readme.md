### The xhb-ewmh package

Utility functions for working with properties as defined by the
[EWMH specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html#idm140200472615568).

However, it is still necessary to read the specification, because some
properties should only be changed through requests and not directly by clients.

Documentation can be found on [hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xhb-ewmh).
